As you know, CLOP is a command line system - all task work in terminal/console. 

If in GUI application, you click menu/button to run feature. But in TUI (Terminal UI) you run features via params (or arguments). 

```Arguments``` is know as keywords that split by *space* and set name with increase number.

For example, if I type 

```
clop install quocthinhvo/packa
```

CLOP will get argument 1 is ```install``` and ```quocthinhvo/packa``` is argument 2.

For simple, CLOP have ***only 2 arguments***.
